# 🧹 Project 3: Data Cleaning – Oasis Infobyte Internship

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to clean raw and messy datasets to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for further data analysis and visualization. This task was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing.

## 🏢 Internship Details
- **Program:** Data Science Internship
- **Organization:** Oasis Infobyte
- **Role:** Data Analyst Intern
- **Project Title:** Data Cleaning – Project 3

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset provided contained common data quality issues:
- Null or missing values
- Duplicate rows
- Inconsistent column naming and formatting
- Mixed data types
- Unnecessary or irrelevant fields

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive cleaning
- **Power BI** for optional post-cleaning validation
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration

## 🔄 Cleaning Workflow
1. **Data Inspection**
   - Reviewed structure, types, and quality of the raw data
2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Applied suitable techniques: deletion, imputation, or filling
3. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Identified and dropped redundant rows
4. **Data Type Standardization**
   - Converted date strings to `datetime`, numerics to `int`/`float`
5. **Renaming Columns**
   - Renamed headers to `snake_case` for readability and consistency
6. **String Cleanup**
   - Removed unwanted characters, extra spaces, and fixed text casing
7. **Dropping Irrelevant Data**
   - Removed columns that did not contribute to analysis

## ✅ Deliverables
- `cleaned_airbnb_data.csv`: Final cleaned dataset
- `Project 3_Cleaning Data.ipynb`: Python notebook with all cleaning steps and explanations
- Documentation with cleaning decisions and rationale

## 📊 Outcome & Usage
The cleaned dataset is now ready for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization using Power BI
- Customer segmentation or pattern discovery
- Predictive modeling (if extended)

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Developed a strong understanding of the importance of clean data
- Practiced Python-based data wrangling techniques
- Learned how to assess, handle, and document data quality issues
